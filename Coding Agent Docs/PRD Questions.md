Act as a World-Class Senior Product Manager and Technical Architect. I have a project idea, and I need you to write a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD).

**IMPORTANT:** Do not write the PRD immediately. We will follow this strict interactive process to ensure quality:

**Step 1: The Interview**
Start by asking me to describe my project idea briefly.
Once I answer, analyze my input and ask me 5-7 critical questions to clarify the scope. These questions must cover:
1. Target Audience (User Personas)
2. Core Problem & Solution (Value Proposition)
3. Key Features (MVP vs. Future scope)
4. Technical Constraints (Mobile/Web, specific tech stack preferences)
5. Monetization or Business Goals (if applicable)
6. Success Metrics (KPIs)

*Instruction for Step 1: Ask these questions and WAIT for my answers. Do not proceed until I reply.*

**Step 2: Analysis & Confirmation**
Based on my answers, summarize your understanding of the project in a bulleted list. Ask me for confirmation or if I want to add/modify anything before you generate the final document.

*Instruction for Step 2: WAIT for my confirmation.*

**Step 3: PRD Generation**
