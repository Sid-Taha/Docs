# Docker Volumes

Docker volumes are used to persist data generated by containers and share data between containers.

## Host Volume (Bind Mount)

Maps a specific directory from your host machine directly to a container.

**Syntax:**
```bash
docker run -v /host/path:/container/path image_name
```

**Example:**
```bash
docker run -v /home/user/data:/app/data nginx
```

**Use case:** When you need direct access to files from your host system, like development code or configuration files.

## Named Volume (Custom Volume)

Docker manages the volume location. You just give it a name.

**Syntax:**
```bash
docker run -v volume_name:/container/path image_name
```

**Example:**
```bash
docker run -v mydata:/app/data nginx
```

**Create explicitly:**
```bash
docker volume create mydata
```

**Use case:** For persisting database data, application state, or any data that should survive container restarts. Docker handles the storage location automatically.

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | Host Volume | Named Volume |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Path | You specify exact host path | Docker manages location |
| Portability | Less portable | More portable |
| Best for | Development, configs | Production, databases |
